Code Steps:
1. Take number of processes(n) and CPU time(bt[]) for each process
2. Take priority number for each process
3. Sort priority using selection sort
• Step 1: set min to the first location
• Step 2: search the minimum element in pr1[]
• Step 3: swap the first location with the minimum value in bt[]
• Step 4: swap process number p[] and bt[] and repeat the steps
4. Arrival time =0 for all processes and waiting time for first process=0
5. Calculate waiting time for each process (waiting time = sum of CPU time for the previous
processes)
6. Calculate total waiting time(sum of waiting time for all processes)
7. Sort priority, burst time, process number and waiting time using selection sort in ascending
order for process number
8. Display results
9. Average waiting time total/number of processes
10. Display average waiting time
