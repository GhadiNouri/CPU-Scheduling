FCFS => First Come First Served.

Code Steps:
1. Take number of processes(n) and CPU time(bt[]) for each process
2. Arrival time =0 for all processes and waiting time for first process=0
3. Calculate waiting time for each process (waiting time = sum of CPU time for the previous
processes)
4. Calculate total waiting time(sum of waiting time for all processes)
5. Display results
6. Average waiting time total/number of processes
7. Display average waiting time
