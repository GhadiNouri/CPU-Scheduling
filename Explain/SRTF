SRTF => Short Remaining Time First.

Code Steps:
*Since the arrival time is equal to 0*, SRTF is equivalents to SJF, but if the arrival time for each process is 
different, then it will follow the same steps as the SJF except that it will check each time for which has 
less remaining time and if it arrived or not. If not arrived then it will complete the current process, if itâ€™s 
arrived then it will preempt the current process and start the new one, and the procedure will be repeated 
each time a new process will arrive.
